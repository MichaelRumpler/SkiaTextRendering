# SkiaTextRendering
Sample code for the blog post [The Trouble with Text Rendering in SkiaSharp and HarfBuzz](https://www.mrumpler.at/the-trouble-with-text-rendering-in-skiasharp-and-harfbuzz).

The text rendering code is in [TextInfo.cs](SkiaTextRendering/Views/TextInfo.cs)
and the performance tuning of `DrawShapedText` in [CanvasExtensions.cs](SkiaTextRendering/Extensions/CanvasExtensions.cs).
